# Duel-of-Sages [no-AI]

[Click here for the Duel of Sages](https://hemareso.github.io/Duel-of-Sages/)

A typing racer game.
The game's objective is to test of the fastest sage(typer).

Using:
  - phaser for UI
  - webrtc for P2P communication
  - firestore for webrtc negotiation

Pet project for contact with the modern p2p world.

Still in development.

Notes:
 - all negotiation data has End to End encryption.
 - There is a chance, a connection is not feasible. The p2p covers STUN based connections only (amount to 80% of them according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52485683))
